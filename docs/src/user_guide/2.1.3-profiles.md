# Profiles

## Profile
*A profile is like an export preset in Photoshop*

A profile is a predefined way of handling and saving images downloaded from Figma. It specifies how an image should be saved â€” its format (e.g., PNG, SVG, WEBP), quality, scale, and destination folder.

You can think of a profile as a "recipe" or "template" for processing images.

FigX comes with built-in profiles for importing PNG, SVG, WEBP, and many other types of assets. These profiles can be customized in the `figxconfig.toml` file. You can define your own custom profiles based on these built-in ones, allowing you to extend or tweak their behavior without starting from scratch.

**Example configuration for different profiles:**

```toml
[profiles.webp]
# The scale at which the image will be exported
scale = 2.0
# The target quality of the image when converting to WEBP (range: 0 to 100)
quality = 85
# The directory where the downloaded WEBP images will be saved
output_dir = "res/img"

[profiles.android-drawable-xml]
# The scale at which the image will be exported
scale = 1.0
# Android project res dir
android_res_dir = "src/main/res"
```

**Custom Profiles:**

You can modify these built-in profiles to suit your needs, or you can inherit from them to create custom profiles that retain all settings of the original profile and add your custom adjustments.

For example, you could create a custom profile that scales images differently and outputs them to a new directory, inheriting from the default png profile:

```toml
[profiles.illustrations]
extends = "png"
scale = 2.0
output_dir = "res/illustrations"
```

This would use the settings from profile `png`, but with a custom scale and output directory.
