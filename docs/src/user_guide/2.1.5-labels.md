# Labels

## Label
*A label in FigX is the same concept as a label in Bazel.*

A label in FigX is a canonical identifier for a resource or package within a workspace. It follows the format:
```text
//path/to/package:resource-name
```
where:
- `//` refers to the root of the FigX workspace
- `path/to/package` is the relative path to the package containing the resource
- `resource-name` is the name of the resource defined in `.fig.toml`.

Labels are used to reference resources unambiguously across different packages.

## Label matching

Each resource defined in a fig-file (`.fig.toml`) has a label, which is made up of the package path and the resource name.

### Example
Letâ€™s say you have two fig-files:

**Root-level `.fig.toml`:**

```toml
[svg]
ic_crab = "Icons/Crab"
```

**Inside `foo/bar/.fig.toml`:**

```toml
[svg]
ic_star = "Icons/Star"
```

Now your workspace contains two resources with the following labels:
- `//:ic_crab` â€” located at the root of the workspace
- `//foo/bar:ic_star` â€” located in the `foo/bar` package

### Label Patterns

Most FigX commands accept label patterns that define which resources to operate on.
This pattern matching works similarly to how it's done in Bazel or Buck2.

For example:

- `figx import //...`<br>
  â†’ Matches all resources in the workspace (recursive wildcard)

- `figx import //:all`<br>
  â†’ Matches only resources in the root package (non-recursive)

- `figx import //foo/bar:ic_star`<br>
  â†’ Matches a single, specific resource

- `figx import //foo/...`<br>
  â†’ Matches all resources under foo/, including nested packages

### Why itâ€™s like Bazel

This label syntax is inspired by the build system Bazel, and follows a similar convention.
