# Recipes

This section provides a collection of recipes for almost every use case. It includes ready-made configuration examples for importing assets from Figma into projects of varying structure and complexity. While basic import scenarios can be configured manually with little effort, setting up a multi-stage pipeline tailored to a mature project can be far more challenging. Feel free to use these examples as a starting point and adapt them to your needs.
