# Workspaces, Packages, Resources

## Workspace
*Think of it like a workspace in Bazel or Buck2*

A workspace is the root directory of a monorepo that contains the marker file `.figmagic.toml` and all its child directories. The `.figmagic.toml` file holds configuration that is shared across all packages within the workspace.

## Package
*Similar to a package in Bazel or Buck2*

Just like in Bazel, a package is any subdirectory within the workspace that contains a `.fig.toml` file, aka "fig-file". This file defines the package’s local configuration and the list of design resources to import. Intermediate directories between the workspace root and a `.fig.toml` file are not considered packages.

**Example project structure:**

```text
foo/ 
└── bar/ 
    └── .fig.toml 
.figmagic.toml
```

In this example, there is a single package: `//foo/bar`. The double slash `//` refers to the root of the workspace.

## Resource
*A resource is anything you want to pull from Figma*

A resource is an image or a set of images you want to import from Figma into your project. This could be an icon, logo, illustration, or any other visual asset. In the `.fig.toml` file, you define which resources to download and how—for example, specifying the format (like PNG, SVG, etc.).
