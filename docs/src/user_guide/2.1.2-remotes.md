# Remotes

## Remote
*Similar to a remote in Git*

In the context of FigX, a **remote** refers to a specific file or frame in Figma from which assets are exported. Remotes tell FigX where to fetch the specified resources from.

You can define as many remotes as you need. Different remotes can point to entirely different Figma files, or to different containers, frames, or nodes within the same file.

At least one remote must be marked as default = trueâ€”this tells FigX which source to use if no remote is explicitly specified for a resource.

**Example configuration in `.figxconfig.toml` (workspace root):**

```toml
[remotes.icons]
default = true
file_key = "LlHCBPLR7yasnxwfsnCapl"
container_node_ids = ["8188-258268", "8188-258269"]
# access_token = ...

[remotes.illustrations]
file_key = "aBcD1234EfGhIjKlMnOpQrSt"
container_node_ids = ["9900-112233"]
# access_token = ...
```

**Notes:**
- `access_token` can be provided directly or via an environment variable using the syntax `access_token.env = "<ENV_NAME>"`.
- `file_key` is the unique Figma file identifier.
- `container_node_ids`: This field should contain the node IDs of specific frames or groups within the Figma file where the resources are stored. It is essential because downloading the entire file may be slow and inefficient. By specifying the node IDs, you target specific areas of the file, which speeds up the process and allows for better caching.
