# Setup

Ready to make FigX part of your workflow?

This section will guide you through setting up FigX in your project — from the simplest possible example to more advanced workspace layouts.

You'll start by configuring the basics: adding your Figma access token, and creating your first `.figxconfig.toml` file. From there, we’ll move step-by-step through progressively more powerful setups, including multi-package monorepos, custom profiles, and multiple remotes.

Whether you're prototyping or building a full design pipeline, these examples will help you get FigX running smoothly in your environment.

Let’s get started!
