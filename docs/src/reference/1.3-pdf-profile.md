# PDF Profile

## Purpose

The profile is designed for importing PDF assets from Figma.

The asset import process consists of the following stages:
1. Fetch Figma remote: [REST API reference](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#get-file-nodes-endpoint)
1. Locate the node ID by the specified name
1. Request PDF export from Figma using the node ID: [REST API reference](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#get-images-endpoint)
1. Download the exported PDF file

## Complete Configuration in `figxconfig.toml`

```toml
[profiles.pdf]
# ID from the [remotes] section. 
# Uses the default remote if unspecified, but can reference any configured remote
remote = "some_remote_id"
# Export scale for the image from Figma (default: 1.0)
scale = 1.0
# Target directory for downloaded assets. 
# Defaults to empty (root package directory where .fig.toml resides)
output_dir = "some_dir"
```
