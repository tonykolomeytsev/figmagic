# PNG Profile

## Purpose

The profile is designed for importing PNG assets from Figma.

The asset import process consists of the following stages:
1. Fetch Figma remote: [REST API reference](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#get-file-nodes-endpoint)
1. Locate the node ID by the specified name
1. Request PNG export from Figma using the node ID: [REST API reference](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#get-images-endpoint)
1. Download the exported PNG file

## Complete Configuration in `figxconfig.toml`

```toml
[profiles.png]
# ID from the [remotes] section. 
# Uses the default remote if unspecified, but can reference any configured remote
remote = "some_remote_id"
# Export scale for the image from Figma (default: 1.0)
scale = 1.0
# Target directory for downloaded assets. 
# Defaults to empty (root package directory where .fig.toml resides)
output_dir = "some_dir"
# Defines the naming convention for local (output) files corresponding to variants.
# Use placeholders: {base} for the base icon name, {variant} for the variant suffix.
variant_naming.local_name = "{base}{variant}"
# Defines the expected naming convention in Figma for icon variants.
# Use placeholders: {base} for the icon name in Figma, {variant} for the variant identifier.
variant_naming.figma_name = "{base}_{variant}"
# Specifies the list of variant identifiers to import and process for each base asset.
# Each entry represents a suffix used in Figma naming (e.g., 'icon_24', 'icon_16').
# If empty, variant handling is disabled and only base assets are imported.
variants = ["24", "16"]
```
