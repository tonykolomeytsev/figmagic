# PNG Profile

## Purpose

The profile is designed for importing PNG assets from Figma.

The asset import process consists of the following stages:
1. Fetch Figma remote: [REST API reference](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#get-file-nodes-endpoint)
1. Locate the node ID by the specified name
1. Request PNG export from Figma using the node ID: [REST API reference](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#get-images-endpoint)
1. Download the exported PNG file

## Complete Configuration in `.figtree.toml`

```toml
[profiles.png]
# ID from the [remotes] section. 
# Uses the default remote if unspecified, but can reference any configured remote
remote = "some_remote_id"
# Export scale for the image from Figma (default: 1.0)
scale = 1.0
# Target directory for downloaded assets. 
# Defaults to empty (root package directory where .fig.toml resides)
output_dir = "some_dir"
# Specifies which variants to use. Only the listed keys will be processed.
# Can be overridden in .fig.toml for each resource
variants.use = ["L", "M", "S"]
# Available variants
# output_name - filename for the exported file
# figma_name - node name in Figma to look for
variants.L = { output_name = "{base}L", figma_name = "{base}_24" }
variants.M = { output_name = "{base}M", figma_name = "{base}_20" }
variants.S = { output_name = "{base}S", figma_name = "{base}_16" }
variants.XS = { output_name = "{base}XS", figma_name = "{base}_12" }
```
