# Compose profile

## Purpose

The profile is designed for importing vector assets from Figma and converting them directly into Compose's ImageVector format.

The asset import process consists of the following stages:
1. Fetch Figma remote: [REST API reference](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#get-file-nodes-endpoint)
1. Locate the node ID by the specified name
1. Request SVG export from Figma using the node ID: [REST API reference](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#get-images-endpoint)
1. Download the exported SVG file
1. Simplify the SVG to retain only groups and paths (using usvg library)
1. Convert the simplified SVG to ImageVector format

## Complete Configuration in `.figmagic.toml`

```toml
[profiles.compose]
# ID from the [remotes] section. 
# Uses the default remote if unspecified, but can reference any configured remote
remote = "some_remote_id"
# Export scale for the image from Figma (default: 1.0)
scale = 1.0
# Path to Kotlin source directory
# Defaults to empty (files are placed in package root alongside .fig.toml)
src_dir = "src/res/main"
# Target Kotlin package for generated *.kt files
# When unspecified, figmagic attempts to auto-detect the package
# Explicit empty string will omit package declaration
package = "com.example.mypackage"
# When true, all generated Kotlin fields will have explicit visibility modifiers
# Default: false
kotlin_explicit_api = false
# Fully qualified class/object name to extend with generated ImageVector
# When specified:
# - Adds required import
# - Modifies declaration to: public val ${extension_target}.{icon_name}: ImageVector = ...
extension_target = "com.example.mypackage.AppIcons"
# Lint suppressions to add via @file:Suppress(...)
# Default: empty list
file_suppress_lint = ["LongMethod", "MagicNumbers"]
# Color transformations to apply during generation
# Default: no transformations
color_mappings = [
    # Example: replace all colors with Color.Black
    { from = "*", to = "Color.Black" },
    # Example: replace all red colors (#ff0000) with Color.Red
    { from = "ff0000", to = "Color.Red" },

    # IMPORTANT: 
    # - 'from' must be a HEX color code WITHOUT alpha channel
    #   (alpha is lost during SVG simplification and handled via group opacity)
    # - 'to' must contain exact code to be inserted
]
# Custom preview generation template
# Overrides default figmagic preview implementation
preview.code = """
@Preview
@Composable
private fun Preview() {
    Icon(imageVector = {name}, contentDescription = null)
}
"""
# Additional imports to include with preview
preview.imports = [
    "androidx.compose.ui.tooling.preview.Preview",
    "androidx.compose.runtime.Composable",
]

# Defines the naming convention for local (output) files corresponding to variants.
# Use placeholders: {base} for the base icon name, {variant} for the variant suffix.
variant_naming.local_name = "{base}{variant}"

# Defines the expected naming convention in Figma for icon variants.
# Use placeholders: {base} for the icon name in Figma, {variant} for the variant identifier.
variant_naming.figma_name = "{base}_{variant}"

# Specifies the list of variant identifiers to import and process for each base asset.
# Each entry represents a suffix used in Figma naming (e.g., 'icon_24', 'icon_16').
# If empty, variant handling is disabled and only base assets are imported.
variants = ["24", "16"]
