# WEBP profile

## Purpose

The profile is designed for importing WEBP assets from Figma.

The asset import process consists of the following stages:
1. Fetch Figma remote: [REST API reference](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#get-file-nodes-endpoint)
1. Locate the node ID by the specified name
1. Request PDF export from Figma using the node ID: [REST API reference](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#get-images-endpoint)
1. Download the exported PNG file
1. Convert the downloaded PNG to WEBP format (using `libwebp`)

## Complete Configuration in `.figtree.toml`

```toml
[profiles.webp]
# ID from the [remotes] section. 
# Uses the default remote if unspecified, but can reference any configured remote
remote = "some_remote_id"
# Export scale for the image from Figma (default: 1.0)
scale = 1.0
# Target directory for downloaded assets. 
# Defaults to empty (root package directory where .fig.toml resides)
output_dir = "some_dir"
# Output quality for WEBP conversion (0-100)
# Defaults to 100 (lossless) - recommended value
quality = 100
# TODO
