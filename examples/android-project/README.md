# Android project with FigX

This project demonstrates how to integrate FigX into an Android project.

In the root of the project, two custom import profiles are defined in the `.figtree.toml` file:
1. icons profile â€” Inherits all properties from the built-in compose profile, which is designed for importing icons from Figma into the ImageVector format for Jetpack Compose.
2. illustrations profile â€” Inherits all properties from the android-webp profile, which supports importing illustrations from Figma into all drawable-*dpi directories and compresses them into the WEBP format.

**Creating new profiles is optional.** You could configure and use the built-in profiles directly (`android-webp` + `compose`). However, defining custom profiles with domain-specific names makes the configuration more expressive and easier to understand. Using meaningful names like `icons` and `illustrations` is especially helpful for teams familiar with tools like [figma-export](https://github.com/RedMadRobot/figma-export).

Moreover, FigX is not limited to just these two profiles â€” you can define as many as you need to fit your projectâ€™s requirements and domain logic.

> **Note (by design):** Custom profiles can only extend built-in profiles. This is an intentional safeguard to prevent overly complex and unnecessary abstractions â€” a common issue known as "Java brain disease."

**More notes:**
- The `icons` profile loads resources from a Figma file that contains the icon library. See the remote named `icons`.
- The `illustrations` profile looks for resources in a completely different Figma file. See the remote named `illustrations`.

## Example Commands

Import all resources:

```bash
figx import //...
```

Import only WEBP drawable resources (from the `//app` package):

```bash
figx import //app:all
```
> Note: `//app:*` is also a valid argument, but it wonâ€™t work in **zsh** unless you escape the glob pattern with quotes `"//app:*"` or disable globbing using `setopt noglob`.

Import only Jetpack Compose icons (from the `//app/src/main/java/com/example/figxdemo/ui/icons` package):

```bash
figx import //.../ui/icons:all
```

List all **figx resources** in the project without importing them:

```bash
figx query //...
```

List all **figx packages** in the project:

```bash
figx query -o package //...
```

Explain the import flow for specific resources:

```bash
figx explain //app:all //.../ui/icons:Sun
```

Example output:
